## :pushpin: Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive terminal-style portfolio — a unique blend of vintage aesthetics and modern tech.

This isn’t just a portfolio. It’s a command-line experience that lets you explore my projects, read my bio, and uncover my work in a fun, nostalgic way — like hacking into a ‘90s mainframe (minus the legal issues).
