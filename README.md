## :pushpin: Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive terminal-style portfolio ‚Äî a unique blend of vintage aesthetics and modern tech.

This isn‚Äôt just a portfolio. It‚Äôs a command-line experience that lets you explore my projects, read my bio, and uncover my work in a fun, nostalgic way ‚Äî like hacking into a ‚Äò90s mainframe (minus the legal issues).
